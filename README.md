# Overview of Movie Zone Database System Project

In this database project, I was tasked with developing a database system for Movie Zone, a cinema, as a database developer at Creative Developers Company (CDC). The project involved designing and implementing a relational database to streamline the movie reservation process for Movie Zone customers. The project can be summarized in the following key points:

Transferable Skills and Competencies Developed:

- Designing a good database system.
- Building an efficient database system.
- Studying user and system requirements.
- Testing the database.
- Requirements analysis skills.

## Vocational Scenario:
The Movie Zone General Manager required a database system that allows customers to search for movies, know their genres, reserve movies, and access additional services. Customers are required to have a unique account with various personal details, and each movie is described by various attributes. The database also maintains information about movie genres and production companies.

## Key Rules and Restrictions:
Several rules and restrictions were imposed on the database to ensure data accuracy, including revenue thresholds, default values for certain fields, duration requirements, and uniqueness constraints.

## Assignment Activities and Guidance:
### The project was divided into three main tasks:

#### Task 1: Designing Database System

- Investigating and documenting system and user requirements.
- Creating an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).
- Building a relational database with tables, fields, data types, and constraints.
- Ensuring database normalization.
- Designing input and output interfaces.
- Assessing and validating the design against requirements.

#### Task 2: Implementing the Database System
- Choosing an appropriate Database Management System (DBMS).
- Implementing validation methods and SQL queries.
- Creating interfaces for data manipulation.
- Adding security measures to protect the database.

#### Task 3: Evaluating the Database System
- Measuring the database solution against user and system requirements.
- Recommending improvements based on the assessment.
- Developing a test plan and conducting testing.
- Discussing scalability and maintainability improvements.

## Feedback from the Subject Professor:
The feedback from the subject doctor is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting the successful completion of the course and the effectiveness of the database design and implementation. Key points of praise include:
- Successful completion of the Database Development and Design Course.
- Designing a relational database using appropriate tools.
- Creating a well-designed interface that aligns with system requirements.
- Suggesting valuable improvements to enhance the system's effectiveness.
- Properly measuring the database's effectiveness against user and system requirements.
- Successfully defining data types, keys, and constraints.
- Demonstrating proficiency in data normalization.

Overall, the project represents a commendable effort in applying database development and design concepts to address real-world business needs effectively.
